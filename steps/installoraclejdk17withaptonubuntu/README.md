Attune Automation Project to install Oracle JDK on Ubuntu.

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is an essential software development 
environment for Java platform programming. It encompasses a comprehensive 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE), often referred to as a private runtime. The 
term 'private runtime' signifies that it includes additional tools beyond 
the standalone JRE, along with all the necessary components required for 
Java application development.
